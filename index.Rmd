## Goals

The application of [spaceMap](https://topherconley.github.io/spacemap/) to different breast cancer subtypes from the [METABRIC study data](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v486/n7403/full/nature10983.html) is an experiment to see how spaceMap learns meaningful tumor network structures common to all subtypes and also distinguishes them.
